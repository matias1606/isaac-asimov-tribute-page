				<p>“NINETY-EIGHT – NINETY-NINE – ONE HUNDRED.” Gloria withdrew her chubby little forearm from</p>
				<p>before her eyes and stood for a moment, wrinkling her nose and blinking in the sunlight. Then,</p>
				<p>trying to watch in all directions at once, she withdrew a few cautious steps from the tree against</p>
				<p>which she had been leaning.</p>
				<p>She craned her neck to investigate the possibilities of a clump of bushes to the right and then</p>
				<p>withdrew farther to obtain a better angle for viewing its dark recesses. The quiet was profound</p>
				<p>except for the incessant buzzing of insects and the occasional chirrup of some hardy bird, braving</p>
				<p>the midday sun.</p>
				<p>Gloria pouted, “I bet he went inside the house, and I’ve told him a million times that that’s not</p>
				<p>fair.”</p>
				<p>With tiny lips pressed together tightly and a severe frown crinkling her forehead, she moved</p>
				<p>determinedly toward the two-story building up past the driveway.</p>
				<p>Too late she heard the rustling sound behind her, followed by the distinctive and rhythmic </p>

				<p>clumpclump of Robbie’s metal feet. She whirled about to see her triumphing companion emerge from</p>
				<p>hiding and make for the home-tree at full speed.</p>
				<p>Gloria shrieked in dismay. “Wait, Robbie! That wasn’t fair, Robbie! You promised you wouldn’t</p>
				<p>run until I found you.” Her little feet could make no headway at all against Robbie’s giant </p>strides.</p>
				<p>Then, within ten feet of the goal, Robbie’s pace slowed suddenly to the merest of crawls, and</p>
				<p>Gloria, with one final burst of wild speed, dashed pantingly past him to touch the welcome bark of</p>
				<p>home-tree first.</p>
				<p>Gleefully, she turned on the faithful Robbie, and with the basest of ingratitude, rewarded him for</p>
				<p>his sacrifice by taunting him cruelly for a lack of running ability.</p>
